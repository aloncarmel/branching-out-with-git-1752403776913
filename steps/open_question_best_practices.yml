            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: The user should suggest best practices like
            clear communication, consistent branch naming conventions, frequent
            integrations, and thoughtful choice of strategy based on team size
            and project requirements..

            \    # Assessment Criteria

            \    - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a
            clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the
            expected answer.

            phrasing that convey the same meaning.

            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the

            correct or what may be missing.

            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.
